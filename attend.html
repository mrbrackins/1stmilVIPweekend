<h1><span>Only 6% Of The Women Entrepreneurs&nbsp;Make 6 Figures Or More In Their Business!</span></h1>
         <p>Yes, you heard me right! </p>
        <p>While fundera reports 40% of US business are owned by women, only a small amount ever generate enough to change their own lives and the lives of the people around them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;For black women and women of color the stats are even more devastating. I am here to disrupt this statistic.</p>
        <p> <b> Over the weekend, in addition to the business workshops, several of my current 6 figure plus clients and business besties are going to come out and give you their BluePrint Secrets ( what to do and what not to do).</b></p>
        <p>We believe “each one, teach one” and know that it will take many of us to push, pull and drag each other to the finish line.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;You are just as capable as all of the most incredible bosses you are inspired by, even if it doesn’t feel like it quite yet.</p>
        <p>Multiple 6 or 7 figures, a business with passion, and a strong community of like minded business owners to help, support and grow with you is right on the other side!.</p>
