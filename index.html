                        <p>I’m sure you’ve heard the word funnel so much but you may not be completely sold or fully understand what it is. Simply put, a funnel is just a process. It helps people take your ideal action and get them from point A to point B or point BUY as I like to say. Essentially there are 2 types of funnels. A lead generation funnel, that helps bring new people into your pipeline, and a sales funnel that gets people to purchase from you.</p>

             <h1>Using the wrong kind of funnel</h1>    
             <p>Most people fall into the trap of using a PDF to sell a 500 or 5000 dollar product eyeroll emoji. But there are so many other funnels you can use. (keep scrolling to see them all)</p>
              <h1>Not telling people about your amazing thing!</h1>    
              <p>Yo… a funnel doesn’t work if no one knows about it. You HAVE to send traffic to it for it to work. And because you may see a conversion rate of 1 to 5 percent you will need to send hundreds of people through your funnel a day. So I give you permission to be unapologetically and shamelessly telling the world about your amazing thing!</p>

                 <p>Getting people to purchase from you is a numbers game. As you may have experienced by now, not everyone who interacts with your brand or visits your landing page is going to buy. So you want to make sure you have a constant and consistent flow of traffic/people seeing your offer.</p>
