<h1 class="second-h1"><span>Only 6% Of Women Entrepreneurs&nbsp;Make 6 Figures 
    Or More In Their Business!</span></h1>
         <p>Yes, you heard me right! </p>
        <p>While fundera reports 40% of US business are owned by women, only a small amount ever generate enough to change their own lives and the lives of the people around them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;For black women and women of color the stats are even more devastating. I am here to disrupt this statistic.</p>
        <p> <b> Over the weekend, in addition to the business workshops, several of my current 6 figure plus clients and business besties are going to come out and give you their BluePrint Secrets ( what to do and what not to do).</b></p>
        <p>We believe “each one, teach one” and know that it will take many of us to push, pull and drag each other to the finish line.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;You are just as capable as all of the most incredible bosses you are inspired by, even if it doesn’t feel like it quite yet.</p>
        <p>Multiple 6 or 7 figures, a business with passion, and a strong community of like minded business owners to help, support and grow with you is right on the other side!.</p>
        <p> <b> You know that living the life of your dreams, leaving the corporate plantation, and building wealth and legacy is possible, but likely, not completely sure how to get there.</b></p>

                        <h1>WHAT IS THE BLUEPRINT?</h1>
                        <p>Becoming a self made millionaire is not as difficult a journey as many would imagine. In addition, building a six figure business is well within reach for nearly any business owner who is open to learning, growing, and applying the necessary strategies to their business. The purpose of the BluePrint series and this magical BluePrint VIP weekend is to provide business owners with access to information, tools, strategies, and insights necessary to further build their brands. As you may know, a blueprint is a design plan or model, during my time working with many entrepreneurs and helping them BUILD their businesses there are several success pillars or models that work and that are common for business owners to achieve on the journey. Simply put, the BluePrint is just a series of working models. These Models will take you from point A to point B in your business. For the VIP weekend we will be focusing on 2 types of BluePrints that will help you improve on, protect and grow your business</p>

                            <h2>#1 Business Protection</h2>
                            <p>The number one and most important part of this weekend will be focused on protecting your brand. No business owner should build something on shaky ground. We will not let you pour love, sweat, tears and Money into your business, only to have it stripped away, stolen, or shut down. We will give you the tools needed to protect your work and solidify your space in the business world from copycats and avoidable lawsuits.</p>

                                <h2>#2 Increase Revenue</h2>
                                <p>Increasing your revenue will increase your quality of life, especially when you are increasing your revenue without any extra work on your part. We are going to layout online sales, funnels, flows and give you The BluePrint on increasing revenue rather you have a product or service based business.</p>

                                    <h2>#3 Community</h2>
                      <p>One thing that most self made millionaires have in common is that they surround themselves with other successful, like minded individuals. We have all heard the theory that you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. Regardless of the exact science or magical number of folks in your circle, common sense tells us that being part of a community of folks who not only understand you but can support you, motivate you and share information and resources with you is helpful. That is what the First Million community is all about. The support, inspiration, and mentorship you will receive is alone one of the greatest opportunities to grow your business.                                            </div>

            <h1>&nbsp;Avoiding Sales Systems and Funnels</h1>
            <p>Tech can be scary, I get that. But, what is even scarier is allowing your business to become stagnant because you don't have the proper systems in place to scale and streamline your business and make money in your sleep…. Or better yet while vacationing in the caribbean with mai tai’s on the beach. We will show you how to scale and digitize your business to free up time.</p>
             <h1>Trying to do everything yourself</h1>    
             <p>Rome was not built in a day and it damn sure wasn't built by one person. We teach our clients the 3-2-1 rule. You must focus on the tasks that are necessary to grow your business and expand your revenue. DO NOT get caught up in the busy work! We will show you what needs to be done by you, what needs to be delegated and task you as the CEO should outright avoid.</p>
              <h1>Not Protecting Your Brand!</h1>    
              <p>Come on sis… What is the point in building a brand just to let it be stolen from underneath you or even worse…. Too often business owners skip the vital areas of properly protecting their brand and try to move right into scale. I am here to tell you, copycats are REAL, lawsuits are REAL, mistakes DO happen, and some folks are just outright crazy! We want to prevent you from having to deal with unnecessary headaches as your business grows and have the freedom to build without limits because you are protected!</p>
